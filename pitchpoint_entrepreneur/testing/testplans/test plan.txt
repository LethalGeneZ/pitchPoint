TEST PLAN.
 
PITCHPOINT ENTREPRENEUR MODULE – TEST PLAN
 
1. TEST OBJECTIVES
The objective of this test plan is to verify that the Entrepreneur component of
the PitchPoint system works correctly, is reasonably robust against invalid
input, and respects the specified functional and security requirements.
 
The specific goals are:
 
- To validate the CRUD behavior for Entrepreneur projects:
  - Create project
  - Read/view project
  - Update project
  - Delete project and project files
 
- To verify core account-related functionality for entrepreneurs:
  - Signup
  - Profile update
  - Login form validation (email and password rules – tested in previous boundary tests)
 
- To confirm that key public pages and project pages exist and load the expected
  elements (forms, links, buttons, titles).
 
- To validate helper functions used across the module (URLs, HTML escaping,
  CSRF token generation and validation).
 
Both manual (form-level, boundary and validation tests) and automated unit tests
(using PHPUnit) are included in this plan.
 
 
2. SCOPE
 
In scope (Entrepreneur module only):
 
- Actions (backend scripts) in:
  - pitchpoint_entrepreneur/actions/
    - create_project.php
    - update_project.php
    - delete_project.php
    - deleteProjectFile.php
    - signup.php
    - update_profile.php
 
- Public pages in:
  - pitchpoint_entrepreneur/public/
    - index.php (dashboard for entrepreneur)
    - profile.php
    - project.php
    - edit-project.php
 
- Shared helpers:
  - pitchpoint_entrepreneur/includes/functions.php
  - Entrepreneur actions folder existence (structural check)
 
Out of scope:
 
- Investor module
- Admin module
 
 
3. TEST TYPES AND STRATEGY
 
I used the following test types :
 
1) Manual Functional & Boundary Testing (Black-box)
   - Performed these tests via browser against the running XAMPP environment.
   - Focus on form validation and boundary values:
     - Create project form (title, budget)
     - Login and Signup forms (email format, required fields, password length)
   - Technique: Equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis
     (min, min–1, min+1, etc).
 
2) Automated Unit Testing with PHPUnit
   - Static file-level and logic checks using PHPUnit 10.
   - Verifies:
     - File existence for actions and public pages.
     - Presence of security checks (POST-only, CSRF, require_login).
     - Presence of SQL INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE queries.
     - Presence of key form fields and UI elements.
     - Behaviour of helper functions in includes/functions.php.
 
3) Static Structural Testing
   - Ensures required directories (e.g., /actions) exist and that the module
     structure is correct.
 
 
4. TEST ENVIRONMENT
 
- Local development environment:
  - macOS with XAMPP
  - PHP 8.4.x
  - MySQL (local) with "pitchpoint" database
  - Web server root: /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/pitchPoint/
 
- Tools:
  - PHPUnit 10 (installed via Composer)
  - Browser (Chrome) for manual tests
  - VS Code for code editing
 
 
5. MANUAL FUNCTIONAL & BOUNDARY TESTS (FORM-LEVEL)
 
 
 
 
 
6. AUTOMATED UNIT TESTS – ACTIONS
 
7. AUTOMATED UNIT TESTS – PUBLIC & PROJECT PAGES
 
 
8. AUTOMATED UNIT TESTS – FUNCTIONS & STRUCTURE
